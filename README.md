INSTALLATION
------------

To install the i18n package on Delphi:

1. Open 'i18nPackages.groupproj' that is located in the 'Packages' folder.
2. Build 'i18n' and 'i18nDB' packages.
3. Install 'i18nDesign' package.


HOW TO USE
----------

To localize an application using the i18n package, follow these steps:

1. Drop an instance of TLocalizer component on a data module or your main form.

2. On each  form, frame, data  module, and  report of  your  application  drop a
   TTranslator component.

3. Double click on each instance of TTranslator component and select  properties
   and  string literals/constants  that need to be translated.  Then, export the
   selection into a file.

4. Assign the file name of the exported translatable items  in step 3 to the URI
   property of the TLocalizer component (step 1).

5. Drop an instance of TCultureBox or TCultureListBox  control on a  form, where
   the user selects  the UI language of the application.  Set Localizer property
   of the control to the TLocalizer component in (step 1).

6. Wherever you  need to display or input a date,  use an appropriate control of 
   the i18n  package.  Remember to  set  Localizer  property of  the control  to 
   the TLocalizer component (step 1).

7. Wherever you  format a number or date-time  value in your application, use an
   appropriate formatting method of the TLocalizer component (step 1).

At this  moment, your  application is  localized.  You just need  to translate the
exported translatable strings (step 3) to target languages of your application. To
do so, use **i18nEditor**, which  you can  find its source code in `Editor` folder 
of this repository.
