DESCRIPTION
-----------

The i18n package is a  library  of Delphi components, classes, and procedures to 
fully and  easily localize  Delphi applications  targeting the Windows platform,
and to change the locale of the applications on the fly.

There  are many  software tools  for localizing a Delphi  application, but  they 
mostly  provide  support for  translation  of the user  interface  strings only. 
However, the i18n package not  only  enables  developers to  select translatable
properties  and  string constants/literals within the IDE but also takes care of 
plural forms, reading layout, formatting preferences, and calendar system of the
target language.

You may want that your application be ready for right-to-left languages, but you
do not  know which  language is right-to-left or even how it works? Don’t worry,
the i18n package handles  right-to-left  languages effortlessly.  When locale of 
application changes, and whenever needed, the i18n package automatically mirrors
the layout  of the  application’s forms  according to the  reading layout of the
selected language. You do not need to write a single line of code or even revise 
it.

Although the Gregorian calendar is the  most used  calendar in the world, but if 
your application supports only this calendar, it cannot  be truly  localized for
all countries/regions. The i18n package knows  which calendar  system is used by 
which country/region, and automatically formats date-time values in the calendar
system of the selected locale. You don't  need to modify  your code, because the
application still sees all date-time values in  Gregorian calendar as a standard
TDateTime value. 

The following major calendars are implemented in the i18n package:

- Gregorian Calendar
- Hebrew or Jewish Calendar (הלוח העברי)
- Hijri or Islamic Calendar (التقويم الهجري)
- Jalali or Persian Calendar (گاهشمار جلالی)
- Japanese Emperor Era Calendar
- Julian Calendar
- Korean Tangun Era Calendar
- Taiwan calendar
- Buddhist Calendar

I have tested the i18n package on Delphi 2009 and 2010 only,  but it should work
on the later versions of Delphi as well.

In addition, the i18n package comes with some extra classes for:

- decoding/encoding JSON formatted strings
- setting formatted content of rich edit controls using BBCode styled tags
- parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions in C/C++ language syntax
- parsing Pascal code to extract string literals and string constants

The i18n package also contains  the source code  of a comprehensive Delphi
application for editing/translating exported localizable strings.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install the i18n package on Delphi:

1. Open 'i18nPackages.groupproj' that is located in the 'Packages' folder.
2. Build 'i18n' and 'i18nDB' packages.
3. Install 'i18nDesign' package.


HOW TO USE
----------

To localize an application using the i18n package, follow these steps:

1. Drop an instance of TLocalizer component on a data module or your main form.

2. On each  form, frame, data  module, and  report of  your  application  drop a
   TTranslator component.

3. Double click on each instance of TTranslator component and select  properties
   and  string literals/constants  that need to be translated.  Then, export the
   selection into a file.

4. Assign the file name of the exported translatable items  in step 3 to the URI
   property of the TLocalizer component (step 1).

5. Drop an instance of TCultureBox or TCultureListBox  control on a  form, where
   the user selects  the UI language of the application.  Set Localizer property
   of the control to the TLocalizer component in (step 1).

6. Wherever you  need to display or input a date,  use an appropriate control of 
   the i18n  package.  Remember to  set  Localizer  property of  the control  to 
   the TLocalizer component (step 1).

7. Wherever you  format a number or date-time  value in your application, use an
   appropriate formatting method of the TLocalizer component (step 1).

At this  moment, your  application is  localized.  You just need  to translate the
exported localizable strings (step 3) to target languages of your application.  To
do so, use **i18nEditor**, which  you can  find its source code in `Editor` folder 
of this repository.
